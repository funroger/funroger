Hi,
my name is Victor C.
Recently I've found that I got a lot of useful code came from my pet projects.
There are:
- color conversion
- video decoders and encoders
- scaling functions
- useful tools for video/image/signal processing

I'm planning to release code to a public domain or with very simple license. WIP
